                <p>You want to give your puppy a warm welcome to their new home.</p>
                <p>However, buying for your puppy can be overwhelming when you don’t know where to begin.</p>
                <p>There are many things to know about caring for your new fur baby.</p>
                <p>So, let’s look at this checklist to help you in your preparations when bringing a new puppy home.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="artinfoinner" id='Veterinarian'>
                <h4>Establish a Relationship With Your Veterinarian</h4>
                <p>Veterinary visits are crucial when it comes to caring for pets. Puppies should visit their veterinarian about every three to four weeks, says Dr. Efrem Hunter, DVM, MBA, a vet and Director of Veterinary and Scientific Affairs at Blue Buffalo.</p>
                <p>Chrissy Joy, a celebrity dog trainer and host of The Dog Moms, has four pups of her own. She says that the first few veterinary visits are critical, even for pups who come from healthy moms.</p>
                <p>“ Meeting with your vet soon after bringing your puppy home is important,” she says. Puppies need essential vaccines that allow them to safely explore the outdoors and socialize with other pups. They’re also prone to parasites, which your vet can check for and quickly treat.
                Setting your puppy up with a qualified vet makes it easy to navigate their primary medical care. Consider these factors when choosing your vet:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Distance from home:</strong> You don’t want to drive far for routine visits, and you’ll want to be able to get to the vet quickly in case of an emergency.</li>
                  <li><strong>Services provided:</strong> Make sure the vet offers the services you want, such as dental care, nutrition counselling, and spay and neuter surgeries. Having all services in one office can be a perk, though it’s not mandatory.</li>
                  <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Choose a vet who routinely works with your pet’s breed. Additionally, fear-free certified vets can prevent and reduce fear,anxiety, and stress in pets.</li>
                  <li><strong>The space:</strong> Ask whether you’re able to enter the examination room with your pet and if the office has separate waiting areas and rooms for cats and dogs, as this can help prevent potential conflicts and stress between our different furry friends.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In talking with your vet, you’ll quickly understand that preventative care is key to your pup’s well-being, including keeping vaccinations up to date and protecting your precious pooch against fleas, ticks, and heartworms.</p>

              <div className="artinfoinner" id='PuppyFood'>
                <h4>Puppy Food</h4>
                <p>You’ll need to have plenty of high-quality puppy food on hand for your newly adopted pup.</p>
                <p>To help them power through their days, select a puppy food with a nutritional adequacy statement for growth or all life stages from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). You’ll find this info on the pet food label.</p>
                <img src={fedding} alt="fedding" />
                <p>“It’s always a good idea to ask your vet for nutritional counseling, to make sure your dog’s specific calorie requirements and other nutritional needs are being met,” Dr. Hunter says.</p>
                <p>If your puppy will be 50 pounds or more by adulthood, they may require large breed puppy food.</p>
